# Maze-Search-Algorithm

A Maze Search Algorithm for CS4310 - Design and Analsysis of Algorithms.

# Overview;
I used several graph search algorithms to solve a Pac-Man based traveling salesman problem using A* as my main graph search algorithm and BFS & DFS for comparison
I used the manhattan hueristic distance.
